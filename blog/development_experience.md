# Development experience of Atri framework

- Software runs on system locally
- You can choose your development experience. Eg you can create everything with code or everything with productivity tools such as visual editor or anything in between
- Code exports: the entire code is *auto-synced* and always available to developers 

We can also add a feature (now or in future) that decouples the component code.
